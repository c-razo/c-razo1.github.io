## SSL/TLS Configuration Project

**Description**: This project was initiated after a Nessus scan identified an SSL certificate trust issue on a local Apache server. The scan result prompted a hands-on project to set up HTTPS using a self-signed SSL certificate on Apache.

**Steps Taken**:
- Used OpenSSL to generate a self-signed certificate and configure Apache for HTTPS.
- Updated Apache settings to listen on port 443 and configured SSL.
- Tested the setup by accessing `https://localhost` and documented the browser’s security warning.

**Tools Used**: Nessus, OpenSSL, Apache

**Outcome**: Successfully configured Apache to use HTTPS, demonstrating basic SSL/TLS setup and encryption, despite the self-signed certificate warning.

## Password Cracking & Encryption Project

**Description**: This project focused on understanding password security by exploring password-cracking techniques with John the Ripper and Hashcat. The goal was to create and crack a sample hashed password, simulating a real-world scenario where weak passwords can be exposed. During the process, limitations were encountered due to system resource constraints, offering insight into the hardware requirements for intensive cryptographic tasks.

**Steps Taken**:
- Set up a Kali Linux Debian VM on VMware Fusion with 2 CPU cores and 20 GB storage.
- Installed John the Ripper and Hashcat to test password-cracking capabilities.
- Generated a SHA-512 hashed password using OpenSSL and saved it in a file.
- Used John the Ripper to crack the password, documenting the successful results.
- Attempted to use Hashcat for cracking, but adjusted settings after encountering memory limitations on the VM.

**Tools Used**: John the Ripper, Hashcat, OpenSSL, VMware Fusion

**Outcome**: Successfully demonstrated the process of creating and cracking a hashed password, emphasizing the importance of strong password practices and the role of hardware capabilities in security testing.
